    Hi Maurycy,
      
    Firstly if you want to transfer files from your camera to computer you have to have computer, digital camera and card reader.
    So if you have all of those thinks you schould be able to transfer files. First you need to connect card reader to your computer, 
    after that you need to open software that I attached to this email to transfer files. Now you need to select card reader in the menu.
    You should be prompted to window where you will have to choose the destination of you files, I suggest using photos folder.
    After you select the destination you have to click "ok" button and wait. After a while software will transfer all the data,
    depending of amount of files and the speed of your disk. If you will have any other questions about archaic technology, please ask your grandparents.

    Best regards,
    XYZ
