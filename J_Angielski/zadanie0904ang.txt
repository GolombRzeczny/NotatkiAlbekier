Thank you for writting this article, it really made me reflect on the subject but personally I think this article is badly crafted.
      Firstly autor of this article only shows the numbers that works good with his personal point of view.
      I think that if someone writes on facts, he schould have given all the facts to the reader not only the ones that works for him. 
      Secondly the he shows the problem as somethink new, directly connected to newest generation of people.
      I also think that there's a big problem with how young people are eating but I would prefer if that problem was not shown so offensivly.
      I would strongly advise that people affected by this article would share they're point of view.
      Other than that I strongly advise young people to eat healthier and consider being more active.
