        Hi Herbert,
        Thank you for letting as stay with your family in Bitchfield. I'll be visiting you with my best friend Frank.
        We met while we were both arrested for war crimes. I'm sure you will like him a lot. His very kind, truthful, responsible and relatable.
        He has characteristic black mustache and short black hair. He usually wears some classy hi-end clothes.
        We are looking forward to sight seeing and everyday live in typical english country. 
        Also it would be really cool if you showed as some of the closest pubs and go for some gambling (Because its legal in england) <3 
        Thank you for letting as stay with you and your family for this week.
        With love,
        Your dearest cousin Gabriel.
