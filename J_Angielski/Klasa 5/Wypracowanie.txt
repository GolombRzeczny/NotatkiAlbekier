Extreme tourism is becoming more and more popular. Many people are seeking for extreme, dangerous and for many people insane experiences like bungee jumps, skydiving and diving in the see. 
There are many advantages and disadvantages of extreme tourism.

On the one hand, there are many arguments for those kind of experiences. First of all it can
be a way to get to know new parts of ones personality. It may be beneficial to know how you react
to thinks like stress and high adrenaline levels in your body. Furthermore for many of this extreme
expierences we have to travel, so we get to know new parts of our world. 

On the other hand thera are severe disadvantages. Most of those experiences are incredibly dangerous for
example in sky diving if you have a problem with your parachute there's only one backup,
provided that the backup will be faulty the are minimal chances of survival.
Many other extreme activities share this fate of being scarly unsafe. Secondly most tourists are not 
expierenced enough for those stunts and many luck muscle mass needed for thinks like skydiving, diving,
conquering the Mount Everest.

To sum up, there are arguments for and against. I personally would not try any of those
extreme expierences but I think that for people who seek adrenaline they may be great ways of spending
time and money.
