      Last week I went for a school trip to Warsaw with my class. Warsaw is the capital of Poland and it's the largest city in Poland.
      I really liked the architecture of the city and how easy to navigate it was, also the pubic transport that we used was really great
      for Polish standards.
      We're visiting a lot of places but my favorites are Musseum of Polish independance, The palace of culture and Łazienki Królewskie.
      I also really liked amound of shops available there but the prices where quite expensive.
      One day when we were going to the old market of the city we accindentally took a wrong bus, We were lost but happilly the teacher asked
      some people for direction and we're able to go to our destination.
      I can really recommend to go to Warsaw because it's a very outstanding city and there is not other city in whole Europe like that,
      Also the polish food is quite nice.
